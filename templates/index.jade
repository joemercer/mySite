            p.lead I study mathematics at the <a>University of Waterloo</a> in Canada. When not studying I'm usually asleep, and it's somewhere in between dreams and reality that I find the time to program. I've worked on several projects and have many more waiting in the backlog. I've also been blessed with the opportunity to write code for <a>Tagged</a> in San Francisco and <a>Bazaarvoice</a> in Austin.
